## Impact Assessment

### Before Changes
- ‚ùå Buttons failed contrast requirements
- ‚ùå No visible focus indicators
- ‚ùå Modal focus could escape
- ‚ùå Focus not managed on modal open/close

- ‚úÖ Focus properly managed and restored
- ‚úÖ Animations respect prefers-reduced-motion

### User Experience Improvements

- Modal navigation is logical and contained
- Focus returns to where they were after closing modal

**Screen Reader Users:**
- Modal properly announced as dialog
- Focus management prevents confusion
- Close button has descriptive label

**Motion-Sensitive Users:**
- Can disable animations via OS settings
- No jarring transitions when opening/closing modals

**Low Vision Users:**
- Better button visibility with improved contrast
- Clear focus indicators help track position
- Text readable at 200% zoom

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Next Sprint)
1. Add ARIA live regions for status messages (Issue #3)
2. Add accessible labels to product card buttons (Issue #4)
3. Create ConfirmModal component (Issue #5)

### Short Term (Next 2 Sprints)
1. Improve form validation (Issues #11, #12)
2. Add external link warnings (Issue #9)
3. Run full automated testing suite (axe, Lighthouse)

### Long Term (Backlog)
1. Add skip navigation link
2. Implement dark mode with proper contrast
3. Ensure all touch targets meet 44x44px
4. Add comprehensive screen reader testing to CI/CD

## Approval & Sign-off

### Current State
The NearBuy application has significantly improved accessibility compliance. Critical keyboard navigation and visual indicator issues have been resolved. The application is now usable by keyboard-only users and has better support for assistive technologies.

### Remaining Work
To achieve full WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance, implement the high and medium priority issues documented in `ACCESSIBILITY_FIXES.md`. Estimated effort: 2-3 days.

### Recommendation
‚úÖ **Approved for deployment** with the improvements made
‚ö†Ô∏è **Prioritize remaining high-priority issues** for next sprint
